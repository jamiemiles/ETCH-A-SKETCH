# ETCH-A-SKETCH

This project gave me further understanding on how to manipulate the DOM and also gave me more practice working with css in order to create a slighlty attactive UI.

- I learned how to create nodes with javascipt and how this dynamic way of working allows for a more fluid and unique UX.
- I had to use a lot of problem solving skills to figure out a lot of issues througout this task. Finding a way to ensure the rainbow feature worked proved to be fairly difficult at first as I couldn't find an ideal solution to provide each RGB element with it's own random number everytime the cursor moved to a new square. After finding a less than idea solution, I concluded that giving each color its own variable and assigning those variables with their own Math.random() function, then applying each variable into the rgb() function worked well!
- I used prompts for the first time today, my experience with Python made it fairly straight-forward to get the grasp of.

* I feel as though my code does not seem particularly clean when looking at it, I imagine this is something that I will become more confident and improve upon the more practice I put in.
